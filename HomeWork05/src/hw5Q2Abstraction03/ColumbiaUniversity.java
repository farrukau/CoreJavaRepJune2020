 02) Copy your previous package "hw4Q2Abstraction02" and rename it to "hw5Q2Abstraction03" inside your HW project and execute the remaining. Read the question very carefully. iii) You have 3 regular class names -- ColumbiaUniversity, NYUniversity, RockefellerUniversity. how many keywords are used for the inheritance in Java for a regular Class? Can an regular Class inherit other Abstract Class or a regular class or interface? How many inheritances is possible by a regular Class? Use the all of above regular Classes and use the keywords to answer my questions.

public class ColumbiaUniversity extends NYUniversity{ //inherits a regular class
	
	// Both 'extends' and 'implements' keywords are used for the inheritance in a regular class. With the extends keyword a regular class can inherit only one regular or one abstract class but can't inherit an interface.
	// Implements keyword is used to inherit Interface in regular class. a regular class can inherit more than one Interface, but cannot inherit a regular class or abstract class by implements keyword.
